# satellite-image-webscrape

Note: For instructions to run the program, read the README.txt, not this. These files are pulled directly from another repository, so some of the things/directory paths need to altered for the program to work.

Tools learnt: Selenium, Python Virtual Environment

This script was created for web scraping images of properties from an aerial/satellite mapping service Nearmap. I had to resort to scraping as their API was not comprehensive enough for my requirements.

Note: I had a licence from my university to use their products. To my knowledge, there are no TOS violations, their own mapping tool even had a print screenshot button.
